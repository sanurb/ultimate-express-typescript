A high-performance boilerplate for creating TypeScript HTTP servers using [Ultimate Express](https://github.com/dimdenGD/ultimate-express) – a drop-in, faster alternative to Express built on µWebSockets. This project is engineered to save time and eliminate boilerplate by providing a production-ready template with modern tooling, streamlined cloning, and robust configuration.

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Ultimate Express TypeScript Boilerplate**. This template equips you with a lightning-fast, production-ready server foundation by replacing Express with the superior [Ultimate Express](https://github.com/dimdenGD/ultimate-express). With the advantages of SWC transpilation, modern TypeScript configuration, and a focus on developer efficiency, you can scale up projects quickly and reliably.

## Motivation

This boilerplate is designed to help you:

- **Accelerate Setup:** Reduce the initial project setup time with a ready-to-go configuration.
- **Enhance Performance:** Replace Express with Ultimate Express for optimized routing and performance.
- **Ensure Consistency:** Leverage modern tools like SWC, Biome, Vitest, and Docker for a consistent development experience.
- **Support Modern Workflows:** Adopt TypeScript best practices and leverage a modular, scalable folder structure.

## Features

- Ultimate Express Integration: Full API compatibility with Express, with significant performance benefits.
- TypeScript-First Approach: Strict type checking and modern project configuration.
- SWC Transpilation: Lightning-fast builds powered by SWC.
- Efficient Testing: Uses Vitest with Supertest for fast and reliable testing.
- Modern Tooling: Biome for linting/formatting, concurrently for process management, and robust Docker integration.
- Stable Node Environment: Latest LTS Node version in .nvmrc
- Optimized Folder Structure: Clear separation of assets, source code, tests, and build outputs for maintainability.
- Comprehensive Testing: Setup with Vitest and Supertest
- Unified Code Style: Biomejs for consistent coding standards
- Docker Support: Ready for containerization and deployment

## Getting Started

### Quick Clone with tiged/degit

For a fast, lightweight clone of this repository, we recommend using [tiged](https://github.com/alexrothenberg/tiged) (or the alias degit). Instead of using `git clone` and downloading the entire commit history, run the following command:

```bash
tiged sanurb/ultimate-express-typescript my-app
```

This command downloads the latest commit snapshot into the folder `my-app`, resulting in a much quicker setup.

### Installation

After cloning, navigate to your project directory and install dependencies using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/):

```bash
cd my-app
pnpm i
```

---

## Usage

### Development Mode

Start the development server with live recompilation and auto-reloading:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This command runs two processes concurrently:
- **watch:compile:** Monitors your TypeScript files using SWC and outputs them into the `dist/` folder.
- **watch:dev:** Launches your server in Node’s watch mode, reloading upon changes.

### Build & Production

For a production-ready build, run:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This cleans the previous build and transpiles your code into the `dist/` directory. To run in production:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production pnpm build && node dist/src/server.js
```

### Testing

Execute your tests with Vitest:

```bash
pnpm test
```

For code coverage, run:

```bash
pnpm test:cov
```

### Linting & Formatting

Keep your code clean and uniform by running:

```bash
pnpm lint       # to check for issues
pnpm lint:fix   # to automatically fix issues
pnpm format     # to format your codebase using Biome
```
